Build your own Electric Guitar class
John Armstrong, Instrutor

Enrollment: Limited: Advance sign-up required
Sign-up by 12/23
Limited to 5 participants
Attendance: Participants must attend all sessions
Prereq: Hobby Shop membership
Fee: $50.00 for Machining tools

Now in its twelth year, this popular class continues to build on the long-standing tradition of instrument making in the Hobby Shop.  Making full use of the Shopâ€™s many tools, including the CNC router, students will build, finish and assemble their own solid-body, bolt-on neck electric guitar or bass. Guitar body blanks can be ordered through Warmouth in Alder, Mohogany or Swamp Ash

The types of instruments available to choose from include Stratocaster and Telecaster-style guitars and a Precision-style bass.  The first step in the process is a required meeting with the instructor in December to select instrument type, body and other parameters.  The result will be a bill of materials that each student must order and have delivered prior to the beginning of class.  The cost of these parts will depend on the wood and components selected with the lower end of the range (for good quality parts) of approximately:
Stratocaster-style guitar, $400
Telecaster style guitar, $375
Precision-style bass, $350
